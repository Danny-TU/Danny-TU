## About Me

Hello, I'm Danny. I have a strong foundation in artificial intelligence, and software engineering, with a particular interest in applying AI across diverse domains. During my master's studies, I focused on integrating network security and AI, developing a Transformer-based intrusion detection system (IDS) for early detection and multi-class classification of malicious network traffic. Additionally, I explored AI model robustness by designing an attack framework that generates obfuscated packets to evade IDS detection, validating the results in real-world environments. I also collaborated with the Telecommunications Technology Center on two industry-academic projects: one aligned with my IDS research, and another on attack detection for facial recognition systems, involving attack process design, verification methods, and detection environment setup.

In my undergraduate studies in Information Management, I led a team to create "Voistock," a stock information system funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology. Using NLP, Node.js, WebSocket, and MongoDB, Voistock provides real-time stock quotes, historical data, and AI-driven news summaries. As the project leader and principal investigator, I handled project planning, team management, news summary development, backend coding, and system integration. Thanks to my strong performance, I was recommended by my professor to work as a contracted engineer at NTU's Department of Graduate Institute of Library and Information Science, where I independently contributed to the development of a big data analytics system.
